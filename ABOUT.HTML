        <p>
        Mohamed Barakatullah Bhopali, known with his honorific as Maulana Barkatullah (7 July 1854 – 20 September 1927),
        was an Indian revolutionary with sympathy for the Pan-Islamic movement. Barkatullah was born on 7 July 1854 at
        Itwra Mohalla Bhopal in Madhya Pradesh, India. He fought from outside India, with fiery speeches and revolutionary
        writings in leading newspapers, for the independence of India. He did not live to see India independent.
        He died at San Francisco in 1927 and buried at Sacramento City Cemetery California. In 1988, Bhopal University 
        was renamed Barkatullah University in his honour. He was also Prime Minister of first Provisional Government
        of India established at Afghanistan in 1915.</p>

        <p> 
          While in England he came in close contact with Lala Hardayal and Raja Mahendra Pratap, son of the Raja of 
          Hathras. He became a friend of Afghan Emir and the editor of the Kabul newspaper Sirejul-ul-Akber'. 
          He was one of the founders of the Ghadar Party in 1913 at San Francisco. Later he became the first prime 
          minister of the Provisional Government of India established on 1 December 1915 in Kabul with Raja Mahendra 
          Pratap as its president. In England, in 1897, Barakatullah was seen attending meetings of the Muslim Patriotic 
          League. Here, he came across other revolutionary compatriots around Shyamji Krishnavarma. After about a year 
          spent in America, in February 1904 he left for Japan, where he was appointed Professor of Hindustani at the 
          University of Tokyo. In the autumn of 1906, at 1 West 34th Street in New York City, a Pan-Aryan Association was 
          formed by Barakatullah and Samuel Lucas Joshi, a Maratha Christian, son of the late Reverend Lucas Maloba Joshi. 
          It was supported by the Irish revolutionaries of the Clan-na-Gael, the anti-British lawyer Myron H. Phelps and of 
          the equally anti-British Swami Abhedananda who continued the work of Swami Vivekananda.
        </p>

        <p>
          In June 1907, a meeting of Indians, held in New York, passed resolutions “repudiating the right of any foreigner 
          (Mr. Morley) to dictate the future of the Indian people, urging their countrymen to depend upon themselves alone 
          and especially on boycott and swadeshi, condemning the deportation of Lajpat Rai and Ajit Singh, and expressing 
          detestation of the action of the British authorities in openly instigating one class of Indians against another 
          at Jamalpur and other places." More vehement was his letter in Persian, which appeared in the Urdu Mualla 
          of Aligarh, U.P., in May 1907, in which Barakatullah strongly advocated the necessity for unity between 
          Hindus and Muslims, and defined the two chief duties of Muslims as patriotism and friendship with all 
          Muslims outside India.
        </p>

        <p>

          In June–July 1911 he left for Constantinople and Petrograd, returned to Tokyo in October and published 
          an article referring to the advent of a great pan-Islamic Alliance including Afghanistan which he 
          expected to become "the future Japan of Central Asia". In December he converted to Islam three Japanese: 
          his assistant Hassan U. Hatanao, his wife, and her father, Baron Kentaro Hiki. 
          This is said to be the first conversion to Islam in Japan. In 1912, Barakatullah became at once more 
          fluent in his use of the English language and more anti-British in his tone. </p>

        <p>
          On 1 December 1915, he established the first Provisional Government of India at Kabul in Afghanistan, 
          during First World War. It was a government-in-exile of Free Hindustan with Raja Mahendra Pratap as president, 
          Maulana Barkatullah as Prime Minister and Maulana Ubaidullah Sindhi as Home Minister.
